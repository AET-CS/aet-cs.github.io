# Assignments to be Turned in Q1

By Sept 30:

1.  Didn't It Rain -- [Leesburg Weather Data set](lessons/hw02.md)

	* did you parse the data, process it somehow and make a plot that supports a conclusion of either a trend or no visible trend?
2.	[London Weather Data set](lessons/hw02.md) [data](./data/london_weather.csv).

	* Same as Leesburg, also did you present your findings intelligently?
3.	[Bayes' Theorem notebook.](lessons/Bayes_Theorem_Student.ipynb)

	* Caluculate the bayes probabilities as methods and plot graphs for fixed incidence and fixed accuracy. Interpret the results

4.	[linear regression notebook](./lessons/least-squares-01.ipynb), ([html version](./lessons/least-squares-01.html))

	* Complete all the cells in the notebook with proper formulas. Produce logical graphs. Be able to explain the results. (same goes for 5,6 below)
5.  Linear Regression on London Weather (see above)
6.  Linear Regression on your own data (may be same notebook as 5.)
7.  [Matrices notebook](./lessons/Matrices-student.ipynb)

	* Complete all cells in the notebook. No assertions fail. Graphs and conclusions are clear and correct.

8.  [Gaussian Elimination notebook](./lessons/Gaussian_Elimination-student.ipynb)

	* Complete all cells in the notebook. No assertions fail. Graphs and conclusions are clear and correct. Error analysis is correct and justifiable conclusions are drawn.

9.  [** Strassen Multiplication (opt)](./lessons/Strassen-Lab.pdf)
10. [** Gaussian Biography (opt)](./lessons/Gauss.pdf)
11. [** Matrix inversion (opt)](./lessons/inversion.pdf)
