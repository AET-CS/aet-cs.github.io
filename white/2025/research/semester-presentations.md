* Presentation slides are due on the date of your presentation, **regardless of school closing!**


*  Here is the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaabaA8aGtDbJrbSegIErp31V0Rbmx8I6a5glg1my2s/edit?usp=sharing) being used for our RSEF selection presentations at the end of the month.

* Here are also [RESF official guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HkImGX4xVBjJtgdYcq98X3ap-L1nihJC/view?usp=sharing) for the acceptable use of generative AI for research projects: Acceptable Use of Generative AI

* Your talk should
    * Be 7 minutes
    * Allow for 2-3 additional minutes of questions
    * Use slides that support your talk -- **not** slides that you expect the audience to read. Keep text to a minimum
    * Quickly move through motivation and into, and spend more time on process and results
    * Clearly indicate what results are missing, and clearly convince the audience you can achieve them

* Submission link for slides coming soon. If it's on some funky website, make sure it's shared with me Dr. White!

* Reminder of previous [presentation guidelines](./presentation-guidelines.md)
