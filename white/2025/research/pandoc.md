Here are some excellent Windows markdown editors that offer both preview capabilities and pandoc integration:

## **Zettlr**
A powerful academic writing tool with built-in pandoc integration. It offers live preview, excellent citation management, and can export to numerous formats via pandoc. Great for academic papers and long-form writing.

## **Typora**
One of the most popular markdown editors with seamless live preview (WYSIWYG-style). While not having direct pandoc integration in the UI, it works well with pandoc through custom export commands and has excellent preview capabilities.

## **Mark Text**
A real-time preview markdown editor that's lightweight and fast. You can configure it to work with pandoc for advanced export options, and it has a clean, distraction-free interface.

## **ghostwriter**
A distraction-free markdown editor with live HTML preview. It has built-in pandoc support for exporting to various formats and offers a clean, focused writing experience.

## **Visual Studio Code**
With extensions like "Markdown All in One" and "Pandoc Citer," VS Code becomes a powerful markdown environment. The "Markdown Preview Enhanced" extension adds excellent preview capabilities, and you can easily configure pandoc integration through tasks or extensions.

## **Obsidian**
While primarily a note-taking app, Obsidian has excellent markdown preview capabilities. You can add pandoc integration through community plugins or custom commands for advanced export functionality.

For the best pandoc integration out of the box, I'd recommend **Zettlr** or **ghostwriter**. For the smoothest preview experience, **Typora** is hard to beat. If you want maximum customizability, **VS Code** with the right extensions gives you the most control over both preview styling and pandoc workflows.

Here are great markdown editors for Mac and Linux that offer previews and pandoc integration:

## **Cross-Platform Options**
Most of the editors I mentioned for Windows also work excellently on Mac and Linux:

**Zettlr** - Available on all platforms with identical functionality
**Visual Studio Code** - Same great extensions work across platforms
**Mark Text** - Cross-platform with consistent features
**Obsidian** - Available on Mac and Linux with full feature parity

## **Mac-Specific Standouts**

**MacDown** - Native Mac app with live preview and pandoc export options
**Marked 2** - Premium Mac app that's primarily a preview tool but integrates beautifully with any text editor and has excellent pandoc support
**iA Writer** - Clean, focused writing with preview capabilities (though pandoc integration requires some setup)
**Ulysses** - Premium writing app with excellent export options, though not specifically pandoc-focused

## **Linux-Specific Options**

**ReText** - Lightweight Qt-based editor with live preview and pandoc support
**ghostwriter** - Also available on Linux with full pandoc integration
**Vim/Neovim** - With plugins like vim-pandoc and markdown preview plugins, becomes incredibly powerful for markdown + pandoc workflows
**Emacs** - With markdown-mode and pandoc-mode, offers comprehensive markdown editing and pandoc integration

## **Terminal-Based (Mac/Linux)**
**Glow** - Beautiful terminal-based markdown viewer
**Pandoc + your favorite editor** - Many Linux/Mac users prefer combining a text editor (like Vim, Emacs, or even nano) with direct pandoc command-line usage

For Mac, **Marked 2** paired with any text editor is particularly popular among power users. For Linux, **ReText** offers a great balance of simplicity and functionality, while **ghostwriter** provides a more polished experience. The cross-platform options like **Zettlr** and **VS Code** often provide the most consistent experience if you work across multiple operating systems.
