You can define what makes weather "worse" -- part of this is definitely subjective. Write your conclusions within your jupyter notebook using markdown syntax (see exiting notebooks for examples.)[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data) for dataset, which retrieved the data from [here](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php)
