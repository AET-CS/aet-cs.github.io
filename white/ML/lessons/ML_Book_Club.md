# ML Book Club

You are a member of research book club (OK so it's an 'article club' but that sounds ridiculous). Working together please pick 3 articles from the resources on [this page](https://aet-cs.github.io/white/ML/background/) that are interesting to the whole group. The articles do not have to have any common topic or thread, unless this is what the group chooses. Each group member will read one article and take notes. Note: the article should be "lengthy." Some of the things you'll find here are just overviews or summaries. A journal article, or something of similar heft written for a technical audience, is the target.


Next week we will meet in book club groups. Each group member will report about their article to the group. Group members can discuss the three articles and what they found interesting and inspiring about them.

As you read your chosen article, keep the following questions in mind. Try to address each of these points in your book club meeting. You may want to take some written notes to help guide your processing of the material.

* What inspired this article?
* What problem does it solve?
* What is the primary creative insight that led to the solution they're proposing?
* What are extensions or applications that you can think of for this research?
* When you think about doing research, and posing research questions of your own, how has this article helped you better understand the process? (This may be difficult at first but I believe every good article teaches us about the research process.)
