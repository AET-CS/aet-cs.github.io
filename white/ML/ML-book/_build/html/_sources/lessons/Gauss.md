# Gauss Presentation

Carl Friedrich Gauss was sickeningly brilliant. Prepare a 10-15 minute lecture on the
accomplishments of Gauss, focusing primarily on mathematics. Give a moderately technical presentation that your classmates will understand that highlight a few of his greatest hits. This should be a whiteboard presentation -- not powerpoint! (If you need a couple slides to show complex diagrams that would be OK, but not needed). This should be presented next Tuesday or Thursday and the beginning of class.
