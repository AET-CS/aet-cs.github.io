# AP Computer Science 12 and Data Structures

  * Instructor: Dr. White
  * Room: 2312
  * Meeting Days: Block 6, B days

## Welcome

Welcome to the AP Computer Science and Data Structures class. This course is designed to deepen your understanding of programming concepts and data structures. We will focus on both mastering the AP CS curriculum and exploring advanced data structures that are essential for problem-solving in computer science.

## About this Class

In this course, we will cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **Fundamental Programming Concepts**: Review of Java basics, object-oriented programming, and essential syntax.
- **Data Structures**: Dive into arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Learn about searching, sorting, and complexity analysis.
- **Advanced Topics**: Explore recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

We will also focus on developing problem-solving skills and preparing for the AP Computer Science exam. The class will include hands-on coding exercises, projects, and theoretical discussions to ensure a well-rounded understanding of both practical and conceptual aspects of computer science.

### Homework etc

Most of your classwork and homework will involve coding exercises and projects. Some tasks will be brief, focusing on specific concepts, while others will be more complex and will require more time. Additionally, you will have quizzes and tests to assess your understanding of key concepts throughout the course.
