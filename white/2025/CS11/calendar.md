## Daily Calendar
- Sept 23, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - Finish and discuss digital circuits
    - Work on [pattern puzzle](./practice/patterns/patterns.md), [pattern challenge](./practice/patterns/pattern-challenges.md) and/or [josephus](./practice/patterns/josephus.md)
    - Circuits [key](./practice/booleans/circuits-key.md) is available
    - HW is to finish *pattern puzzle* worksheet and/or additional hard problems (do problems according to your skill and challenge level!). Submit to the form [link tbd]
- Sept 19, 2025
    - Tracing and Boolean Quiz!
    - Building Digital Circuits [info](./practice/booleans/circuits.md)
    - *Turn In* labeled screenshots in one doc to [this form](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418)
        - We'll have a bit of time next class to work on this if you don't finish all over the weekend. (But only a bit!)
- Sept 17, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - Try out [tracing modifictions](./practice/tracing/simple-mod.md). If needed you can use this [tracing code](./practice/tracing/tracing.java)
    - Complete [Boolean Algebra Practice](./practice/booleans/boolean_algebra_worksheet.md)
    - Short quiz next class: review Boolean Algebra and Tracing worksheet. Practice
        - more [tracing](./practice/tracing/simple-2.md) with [code](./practice/tracing/tracing2.java) and [detailed tracing tables](./practice/tracing/simple-2-detail.md) and [key](./practice/tracing/simple-2-key.md)
        - extra [boolean practice](./practice/booleans/booleans-2.md) or [pdf](./practice/booleans/booleans-2.pdf)
- Sept 15, 2025 (Monday)
    - Finish [Truth Tables](./practice/booleans/truth-tables.md) or [pdf](./practice/booleans/truth-tables.pdf). Note which problems yield equivalent truth tables and write down (also remember!) the rules implied by these equivalencies.
    - Turn in *powers of two* and *tracing* to [this form](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). Your *tracing* solution should be a java file, *powers of two* could be any format depending on how you answered the question.
    - **HW**: Make sure your truth tables are correct and you have the correct equivalencies in your notes. Here's [a key](./practice/booleans/truth-tables-key.pdf)
- September 11, 2025 (Thursday)
    - We did some code tracing practice today. [boolean](./practice/tracing/boolean.md), [loops](./practice/tracing/simple.md) and [tricky](./practice/tracing/ap-level.md)
    - **HW**: Please code up the problems on your selected worksheet and verify if your answers are correct. [More info](./practice/tracing/coding.md)
    - I was going to ask you to do this: Submit powers of two writeup [here](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). You can turn in code in any language or prose or pseudocode -- anything logical. If you get a chance please do. Thanks!
- September 9, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - Download IntelliJ Community Edition and run a sample program. Explore debugger.
    - Work in assigned groups: compare your powers of two code and get one solution working for everybody
    - You can use this [powers of two](./PowerOfTwoFinder.java) solution if you need to
    - HW: Modify your group's solution to work for powers of 4, e.g. 100 = 64+16+16+4. Trace through code with debugger if you don't understand how it works
- September 5, 2025 (Friday)
    - RPN Quiz
    - Writing numbers as sums of: Fibonacci, powers of two, odds, powers of three
    - HW: Write a procedure (or code) to explain how to convert a number into a list of powers of 2 that add to that number. E.g. on input "23" you should output 16,4,2,1. Write code if you know how, otherwise plain English is fine. Explain how you pick the numbers to output in a logical way. Please bring a typed printed copy of your answer to class. (If you can code well enough to output a binary string given an integer input, that's cool too.)
- September 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - four fours puzzle
    - Go over sqrt2 Google sheet [solution key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsKIcdqbSvRl5LXcfM2sJ_XfYE1svEggTNu5w00zUK0/edit?usp=sharing). Make your own copy please
    - RPN quiz next class
        - Here's some [practice and notes](https://adacomputerscience.org/concepts/trans_rpn)
        - Practice from class [last week](./rpn_worksheet.pdf) and the [answers](./rpn_worksheet_answers.pdf)
        - Worked out [rpn problems](./RPN-Stack-Problems.pdf) that show every step with a stack
    - Check the Google sheet above for the *answer key* to the polynomial root problem.
- August 28, 2025 (Thursday)
    - RPN puzzle
    - Clock game square roots in Google Sheets
- August 26, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - RPN practice
    - The "clock game" algorithm
- August 21, 2025 (Friday)
    - Intro to class.
    - RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)
