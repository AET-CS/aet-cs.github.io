# Truth Tables

If you do not have a (good) grade in Phoenix for Truth Tables, then you still need to show me your solution. Hard code your solution to make a truth table for

`!(A && !B) || (C && D) && (!A || !B)`

and show it to me. You can check your output against

`!(A and !B) or (C and D) and (!A or !B)`

Be prepared to answer questions about your code.
