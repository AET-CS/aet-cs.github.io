# Calendar for CS 12

- 8/23/24: Intro to class. We reviewed the class webpage, yearly curriculum, grading and homework policies. Everybody ran "Hello World" to make sure their laptop is OK and we did some `codingbat` problem. Finally we worked on some coding challenges in groups. [Day 1 Coding Challenges](day01.md)


- 8/27/24: Check your coding challenge solutions with these files [Longest Prefix](../code/LongestPrefix.java) -- [String to Integer](../code/AtoIProblem.java)-- [Roman Numeral](../code/RomanToInt.java) -- [Reverse Integer](../code/ReverseInt.java). Run the file in your local IDE and provide the solution where it's asked for. **Homework:** Finish all four problems and bring your solutions to class. If you can't solve one, come with code and precise questions so you can get help.

- 8/29/24: Go over coding challenge problems in class. Submit coding challenge. Begin lesson on boolean algebra and truth tables. Work through the problems on the [Boolean Algebra Worksheet](./boolean.pdf). **HW** Finish boolean worksheet (doesn't need to be typed). Do the circuit simulation online if you can figure out the website! If not, we'll look at it next class. **Turn in** coding challenge next class if you didn't already.

- 9/4/24 (Wednesday): Go over 4 coding challenge problems in class. Review Boolean Algebra homework. DeMorgan's Laws. New coding project: [Truth Tables](../AP_shared/truth-tables.md) You will need [this parser](../code/BooleanExpressionParser.java) to complete part 4.

- 9/10/24 (Tuesday): Finish and turn in Truth Tables. Work on [Credit Card](../AP_shared/Credit_Card_Validation.pdf) In class work on [Coding Bat Arrays 2](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2) or [Coding Bat Arrays 3](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2)
	- test case `(!D || !A) && (!B || C || !C)`
- 9/12/24(Thursday) Benchmark practice AP test in class
- 9/16/24(Monday) Array practice. Review classes. In class do CodingBat array level 2 problems. Class design for a dog, cat, animal set of classes. Turn in Truth Table or Credit Card today if finished. *Show me* truth table if you didn't already and it's done. Quiz Friday!!
- 9/18/24 (Wednesday) No school!
- 9/20/24 (Friday) No school!
- 9/24/24 (Tuesday) School! But Dr. White is out today. There is a quiz review on AP Classroom [also a pdf here](../AP_shared/Quiz_Review_1.pdf). It's set up as a test, but it will not be graded as a test. It's just for review. Also the FRQ questions might not work (like on the benchmark) so please feel free to do those on paper or in another app. You do not need to turn in the FRQ. Please work through review today; feel free to collaborate. I'll push the quiz again to next Monday so we can have some face time Thursday before. We'll also start our next lab Thursday.
    - Quiz topics: Booleans, conditionals, simplifying boolean expressions, basic arithmetic, order of precedence, doubles and ints, div and mod, tracing for loops, simple arrays, writing class definitions, constructors, getters and setters, class methods, toString methods. This should all be review from last year and related to our classwork.
    - HW: Review for quiz
9/26/24 (Thursday) Answers to [quiz review posted here](../AP_shared/Review_1_key.pdf). Quiz next class.
