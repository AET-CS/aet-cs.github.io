# Tracing

Modify the code in the starter questions (as little as possible, often just 1-2 numbers) to yield the following output. Try to solve it on paper first then you can check in the compiler.

```
trace1() =
14 10

trace2() =
36

trace3(7) =
2

trace4() =
7 0

trace5(6) =
3

trace6(20) =
27 3

trace7(8, 15) =
23

trace8() =
9 8

trace9(50) =
17 52

trace10(5) =
20
```
