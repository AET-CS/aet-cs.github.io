# Teaching Calendar 2024-2025
[Quarter 1 Archive](./calendar-q1.md)
## Quarter 2
- 11/6/2024 (Wednesday)
  - Topic: k Nearest Neighbor
  - Devise algorithm in class
  - [Implement in Jupyter](./lessons/knn-Student.ipynb) [(html)](./lessons/knn-Student.html)
  - Also complete extension(s)
- 11/8/2024 (Friday)
  - Continue k-NN. Finish notebook from last class
  - Work on [Digits dataset](./lessons/digits-student.ipynb) [(html)](./lessons/digits-student.html)
  - Here's a [nice writeup](https://towardsdatascience.com/comprehensive-guide-to-approximate-nearest-neighbors-algorithms-8b94f057d6b6) of the approximate nearest neighbor problem with an eye towards ML applications like Spotify and Netflix recommendations (may be a paywall I'm not sure)
- 11/12/2024 (Tuesday)
  - Topic: Intro to decision trees
  - Work on the [Decision Tree Notebook](./lessons/Restaurant_Student.ipynb) [(html)](./lessons/Restaurant_Student.html)
  - Note: Oops I forgot sklearn can't handle categorical features. Ugh. The fix is to one-hot or ordinal encode everything, but that makes for ugly trees.
  - Some [notes on entropy](./ai-notes-decision-trees.pdf) are contained in this chapter. I go through the ABCDEFGH example from class here, starting on p. 63.
  - The wikipedia on [Huffman Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is pretty good to if you want notes on that algorithm
- 11/14/2024 (Thursday)
	- A [Decision Tree learning algorithm](./lessons/Restaurant_Tree.html) based on notes from last class. See how it handles the slightly modified [restaurant dataset](./lessons/restaurant2.csv). The original notebook is [here](./lessons/Restaurant_Tree.ipynb) but running it requires installing `graphiviz`, the graphviz development package, and `pygraphviz`.
	- Work on this [Decision Tree Lab](./lessons/Decision_Tree_Student.ipynb) [(html)](./lessons/Decision_Tree_Student.html) using income data.
	- Here's a [LightGBM Example](./lessons/LightGBM_Example.ipynb) [(html)](./lessons/LightGBM_Example.html) for your viewing pleasure.
	- This [thread](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/11022) may solve the "can't ftp to grumpy inside WSL" problem. Can't test it because both my laptops seem to work fine?
- 11/18/2024 (Monday)
  - Topic: Support Vector Machines
  - [Notes Notebook](lessons/Notes-SVM.ipynb) [(html)](lessons/Notes-SVM.html)
  - [SVM Lab](lessons/SVM_Lab-Student.ipynb) [(html)](lessons/SVM_Lab-Student.html)
- 11/20/2024 (Wednesday)
	- Notes of the math behind SVMs; the 'kernel trick'
	- Please finish SVM lab and pick a topic for research
	- Research project due next week: topic of your choice, in depth EDA, comparison of multiple techniques, selecting best technique, post analysis
- 11/22/2024 (Friday)
  - Classtime for research projet
- 11/24/204 (Tuesday)
  - Research project
  - Quick presentations of techniques and findings
- 12/3/2024 (Tuesday)
  - Cross Validation and Grid Search [notebook](./lessons/CrossValidation.ipynb) and optional [dataset](./lessons/mnist.pk.gz) to gunzip (if the notebook open_ml doesn't work)
  - Apply CV and GS to one of your notebooks (maybe the last research project)
  - Work on FAQ document as time allows (this will be project #4)
- 12/5/2024 (Thursday)
  - Please refer to [these guidelines for Jupyter Reports](./jupyter-reports.pdf), check the feedback on your Report-01, update and resubmit.
- 12/9/2024 (Monday)
  - Ensemble methods
  - Warm up question!
  - See [notes here](./lessons/Ensemble_Methods.ipynb) and complete all "to do" sections.
  - Upload your final notebook to grumpy. Please name it **Ensemble_Methods.ipynb**
  - Report #2 due end of next week. Find your dataset if you haven't already. Plan to do CV, GridSearch and Ensemble methods on this report.
  - Friday and Tuesday will probably be report workdays.
- 12/11/2024 (Wednesday)
  - ROC-AUC curves, tuning decision thresholds
  - Read through the notes [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall) and [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc). The first link is all review for you, but has great visuals and interactive demos. The second one does a great job demonstrating ROC curves.
  - Revisit the [Mushroom project](./lessons/mushroom.ipynb).
		-  (You may want to omit neural network from this because it's slow)
		-  Make ROC curves and compute AUC scores for each of the classifiers we sampled.
		-  Make one plot with ROC curves for all the models on the same graph
		-  For at least one model:
			-  Plot an ROC curve with cross validation [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc_crossval.html)
			-  Tune the classifier threshold using sklearn's tuning ability [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classification_threshold.html)
	-  Upload your results to `grumpy`, named **Mushroom-tuned.ipynb**
	-  Finalize your ideas for Report-02.ipynb, due next Friday
-  12/13/2024 (Friday)
	- Turn in Ensemble and Mushroom notebooks
	- Work on Report-02.ipynb
		- Pick a new dataset (see me for rare exceptions!)
		- Limit yourself to binary classification (you can do multiclass as an extension if you want but start with binarized data)
		- Focus on new skills: CV, GridSearch, Ensembles and reporting AUC and drawing ROC curves
		- Even if your first model accuracy is 98.5, you still need to improve it using new techniques!
		- Due next Thursday
		- Quick notes on precision/recall curves, randomSearchCV, Naive Bayes and Bayes error rate.
- 12/17/2024 (Tuesday)
	- Work on Report due this week
	- Be sure to consult specification from last class and [rubric](./jupyter-reports.pdf)
	- PANDOC update. Looks like "sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-xetex pandoc" will get it working
- 1/16/2025 (Thursday)
	- Anomaly Detection
	- [Gaussian Model Analysis](./lessons/Gaussian-credit.ipynb)
	- [SMOTE Model Analysis](./lessons/SMOTE-credit.ipynb)
	- [Gaussian Mixture model Analysis](./lessons/GMM-credit.ipynb)
	- [dataset](./data/creditcard.csv)
	- [CFG tester](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1156/tools/cfg/)
	- HOMEWORK: Work through all notebooks, think of an "anomaly detection" dataset project to turn in next week.
