# Calendar for CS 12

- 8/23/24: Intro to class. We reviewed the class webpage, yearly curriculum, grading and homework policies. Everybody ran "Hello World" to make sure their laptop is OK and we did some `codingbat` problem. Finally we worked on some coding challenges in groups. [Day 1 Coding Challenges](day01.md)


- 8/27/24: Check your coding challenge solutions with these files [Longest Prefix](../code/LongestPrefix.java) -- [String to Integer](../code/AtoIProblem.java)-- [Roman Numeral](../code/RomanToInt.java) -- [Reverse Integer](../code/ReverseInt.java). Run the file in your local IDE and provide the solution where it's asked for. **Homework:** Finish all four problems and bring your solutions to class. If you can't solve one, come with code and precise questions so you can get help.

- 8/29/24: Go over coding challenge problems in class. Submit coding challenge. Begin lesson on boolean algebra and truth tables. Work through the problems on the [Boolean Algebra Worksheet](./boolean.pdf). **HW** Finish boolean worksheet (doesn't need to be typed). Do the circuit simulation online if you can figure out the website! If not, we'll look at it next class. **Turn in** coding challenge next class if you didn't already.
	* [Filezilla link](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1)

- 9/4/24 (Wednesday): Go over 4 coding challenge problems in class. Review Boolean Algebra homework. DeMorgan's Laws. New coding project: [Truth Tables](../AP_shared/truth-tables.md) You will need [this parser](../code/BooleanExpressionParser.java) to complete part 4.

- 9/10/24 (Tuesday): Finish and turn in Truth Tables. Work on [Credit Card](../AP_shared/Credit_Card_Validation.pdf) In class work on [Coding Bat Arrays 2](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2) or [Coding Bat Arrays 3](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2)
	- test case `(!D || !A) && (!B || C || !C)`
- 9/12/24(Thursday) Benchmark practice AP test in class
- 9/16/24(Monday) Array practice. Review classes. In class do CodingBat array level 2 problems. Class design for a dog, cat, animal set of classes. Turn in Truth Table or Credit Card today if finished. *Show me* truth table if you didn't already and it's done. Quiz Friday!!
- 9/18/24 (Wednesday) No school!
- 9/20/24 (Friday) No school!
- 9/24/24 (Tuesday) School! But Dr. White is out today. There is a quiz review on AP Classroom [also a pdf here](../AP_shared/Quiz_Review_1.pdf). It's set up as a test, but it will not be graded as a test. It's just for review. Also the FRQ questions might not work (like on the benchmark) so please feel free to do those on paper or in another app. You do not need to turn in the FRQ. Please work through review today; feel free to collaborate. I'll push the quiz again to next Monday so we can have some face time Thursday before. We'll also start our next lab Thursday.
    - Quiz topics: Booleans, conditionals, simplifying boolean expressions, basic arithmetic, order of precedence, doubles and ints, div and mod, tracing for loops, simple arrays, writing class definitions, constructors, getters and setters, class methods, toString methods. This should all be review from last year and related to our classwork.
    - HW: Review for quiz
- 9/26/24 (Thursday) Answers to [quiz review posted here](../AP_shared/Review_1_key.pdf). Quiz next class. Will consist of MC and FRQ questions. Be sure you can write loops/conditionals/classes from scratch.
**Please install Schoology Lockdown Browser** if you haven't already!
- 9/30/24 (Monday) Quiz today! After quiz you may begin [Pig latin lab](../AP_shared/PigLatin.pdf). Create one java file PigLatin.java with a main method to preform the transformations. For now stop at STEP 2 (parsing a file). [this is NOT HW yet unless you want it to be] **Please check schoology** for completion grades and upload anything you haven't already (I know many of you added stuff at the end of class today that I still need to update).
- 10/2/24 (Wednesday) PSAT -- nothing planned for today!
- 10/4/24 (Friday) No school
- 10/8/24 (Tuesday) Strings and Scanners: [Pig latin lab](../AP_shared/PigLatin.pdf)
	- Read about [strings](../AP_shared/strings.md)
	- Read about [scanners](../AP_shared/scanners.md)
	- Turn in any missing work! (if you need to show me TruthTables, use [this test case](../AP_shared/true-check.md))
	- Next class: Show me Credit Card
	- Classwork: write [helper classes for PigLatin](../AP_shared/pig-helper.md)
	- Today in class everyone will finish part 1 of PigLatin, using my helper methods. Your code will
		- Read in a file "pig-latin-in.txt" with one word per line
		- Convert all words to pig latin
		- Write each word out to a new file "pig-latin-out.txt"
		- Name your file PigLatin1.java and upload it to the raspberry pi today!
		- Go on to parts 2/3 if you finish. 2 is required. 3 will be the optional bonus for an A+.
- 10/10/24 (Thursday) Finish [Pig latin lab](../AP_shared/PigLatin-2024.pdf). The clarified assignment is
	- Step 1
	- Step 2
	- Step 3
	- Step 4 is optional
	- Due at end of class
	- [File for testing](../AP_shared/PigLatin.txt) and [Bonus File](../AP_shared/PigLatinBonus.txt)
- 10/15/24 (Tuesday) Strings review and practice.
	- do 5 CodingBat String level 1
	- take practice quiz on AP classroom "String MC Practice"
	- Read [bad solution to PigLatin](../AP_shared/badpig.md) and figure out what each line does.
	- Join Juice Mind Class [with this join code](https://play.juicemind.com/joinTeam/ITiQApa9wPwnXKmabxJA)
- 10/17/24 (Thursday). String review and practice
	- A quick review of [array lists](../AP_shared/ArrayListReview.md)
	- Try [this practice on delimiters](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/Unit7-ArrayList/2019delimitersQ3a.html)
	- Next try [this on word gaps](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/Unit7-ArrayList/2016freeresponseQ4A.html)
	- Work through these [multiple choice questions](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/Unit2-Using-Objects/Exercises.html)
	- CodingBat, String-2: endOther, catDog, countCode, xyBalance, plusOut
	- Quiz next class, focus on Strings
	- AP JOIN CODES [for the test](../AP_shared/apcodes.md)
- 10/21 (Monday) **String Quiz today** in Schoology
  - Testing window **11:40-12:55**. You may review until then. Be extra sure you understand *substring, length, indexOf and equals* for string objects.
  - Get testing dividers (the 3d printed bases are in the plastic drawers by the wall. You can also borrow some from Dr. Shapiro)
  - Test is in Schoology; you have the rest of the block to work on it
  - If you are Post-AP, you do not need to test. Instead, please write for me a progress report covering this quarter. What have you been working on? What has succeeded? What has failed? What are next steps? Upload this to the Pi in class.
  - New Lab (if you finish early): [Heat Map Lab](../AP_shared/Unit_2/Heat_Map/Heat_Map.docx) and [Example File](../AP_shared/Unit_2/Heat_Map/Dispersion_Example.docx). Use this [shell code](../AP_shared/Unit_2/Heat_Map/HeatMap.java)
  - Good luck!
