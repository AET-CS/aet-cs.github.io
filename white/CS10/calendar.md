# Calendar for CS 10


- 8/23/24: Intro to class. We reviewed the class webpage, yearly curriculum, grading and homework policies. Everybody ran "Hello World" to make sure their laptop is OK and we did some `codingbat` problem. Finally we worked on some coding challenges in groups. [Day 1 Coding Challenges](day01.md)

- 8/27/24: Check your coding challenge solutions with these files [Longest Prefix](../code/LongestPrefix.java) -- [String to Integer](../code/AtoIProblem.java)-- [Roman Numeral](../code/RomanToInt.java) -- [Reverse Integer](../code/ReverseInt.java). Run the file in your local IDE and provide the solution where it's asked for.
  **Homework:** Finish all four problems and bring your solutions to class. If you can't solve one, come with code and precise questions so you can get help.

- 8/29/24: ~~Go over coding challenge problems in class~~. Begin lesson on boolean algebra and truth tables. Work through the problems on the [Boolean Algebra Worksheet](./boolean.pdf). **HW** Finish boolean worksheet (doesn't need to be typed). Do the circuit simulation online if you can figure out the website! If not, we'll look at it next class.

- 9/4/24 (Wednesday): Go over 4 coding challenge problems in class. Review Boolean Algebra homework. DeMorgan's Laws. New coding project: [Truth Tables](../AP_shared/truth-tables.md) You will need [this parser](../code/BooleanExpressionParser.java) to complete part 4.

- 9/6/24 (Friday): Continue working on Truth Tables in class.

- 9/10/24 (Tuesday): Finish and turn in Truth Tables. Work on [Credit Card](../AP_shared/Credit_Card_Validation.pdf) In class work on [Coding Bat Arrays 2](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2) or [Coding Bat Arrays 3](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2)
  - test case `(!D || !A) && (!B || C || !C)`
- 9/12/24(Thursday) Benchmark practice AP test in class
- 9/16/24(Monday) Array practice. Review classes. In class do CodingBat array level 2 problems. Class design for a dog, cat, animal set of classes. Turn in Truth Table or Credit Card today if finished. *Show me* truth table if you didn't already and it's done. Quiz Friday!!
- 9/18/24 (Wednesday) No school!
- 9/20/24 (Friday) No school!
- 9/24/24 (Tuesday) School! But Dr. White is out today. There is a quiz review on AP Classroom [there's also a pdf here](../AP_shared/Quiz_Review_1.pdf). It's set up as a test, but it will not be graded as a test. It's just for review. Also the FRQ questions might not work (like on the benchmark) so please feel free to do those on paper or in another app. You do not need to turn in the FRQ. Please work through review today; feel free to collaborate. I'll push the quiz again to next Monday so we can have some face time Thursday before. We'll also start our next lab Thursday.
    - Quiz topics: Booleans, conditionals, simplifying boolean expressions, basic arithmetic, order of precedence, doubles and ints, div and mod, tracing for loops, simple arrays, writing class definitions, constructors, getters and setters, class methods, toString methods. This should all be review from last year and related to our classwork.
    - HW: Review for quiz
- 9/26/24 (Thursday) Answers to [quiz review posted here](../AP_shared/Review_1_key.pdf). Quiz next class. Will consist of MC and FRQ questions. Be sure you can write loops/conditionals/classes from scratch.
**Please install Schoology Lockdown Browser** if you haven't already!
- 9/30/24 (Monday) Quiz today! After quiz you may begin [Pig latin lab](../AP_shared/PigLatin.pdf). Create one java file PigLatin.java with a main method to preform the transformations. For now stop at STEP 2 (parsing a file).

**Note: Schoology is updated with what you have submitted in class. Anything "blank" is missing. Please turn in any missing work on Wednesday. Also if Truth Table 15pts is blank you need to show it to me in person so we can discuss your answer. Thanks!**

- 10/2/24 (Wednesday) PSAT day. Please check SCHOOLOGY for your room assignments and seat number. Report to 2312 first for attendance. In class, we have a few quick things
	- Read about [strings](../AP_shared/strings.md)
	- Read about [scanners](../AP_shared/scanners.md)
	- Turn in any missing work! (if you need to show me TruthTables, use [this test case](../AP_shared/true-check.md))
	- Next class: Show me Credit Card
	- Classwork: write [helper classes for PigLatin](../AP_shared/pig-helper.md)
	- Current Project: Pig Latin parts 1 and 2 (there is no shell code file provided)
- 10/8/24 (Tuesday) Strings and Scanners: PigLatin
	- Read about strings and scanners (see last class)
	- Be prepared to show me credit card running on your laptop. Pick any test case you want.
	- Today in class everyone will finish part 1 of PigLatin, using my helper methods. Your code will
		- Read in a file "pig-latin-in.txt" with one word per line
		- Convert all words to pig latin
		- Write each word out to a new file "pig-latin-out.txt"
		- Name your file PigLatin1.java and upload it to the raspberry pi today!
		- Go on to parts 2/3 if you finish. 2 is required. 3 will be the optional bonus for an A+.
