As received, this weather data doesn't describe the columns. I fed the list of column names into ChatGPT and asked it for some descriptions, in case it was a known data format.

This dataset appears to be a collection of weather observations, possibly from METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report) data, which is commonly used in aviation and meteorology. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each column likely represents:

1. **id1/id2**: These columns could be indexing columns that might have been created during the data export or import process. They typically do not hold meaningful information and can be dropped.

2. **station**: The station identifier (e.g., "JYO") where the weather observation was recorded. "JYO" refers to Leesburg Executive Airport in Virginia, USA.

3. **valid**: The timestamp of the observation, given in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

4. **tmpf**: Temperature in Fahrenheit.

5. **dwpf**: Dew point temperature in Fahrenheit.

6. **relh**: Relative humidity as a percentage.

7. **drct**: Wind direction in degrees from true north.

8. **sknt**: Wind speed in knots.

9. **p01i**: Precipitation in inches in the past hour.

10. **alti**: Altimeter setting in inches of mercury, which is used to measure atmospheric pressure.

11. **mslp**: Mean sea-level pressure in millibars (if provided). This is often NaN if not reported.

12. **vsby**: Visibility in miles.

13. **gust**: Wind gusts in knots, if reported. This is often NaN if no gusts were observed.

14. **skyc1**: Sky condition at the first cloud layer (e.g., "CLR" means clear).

15. **skyc2 / skyc3 / skyc4**: Sky condition at subsequent cloud layers, if present. These are NaN if there are no additional layers.

16. **skyl1 / skyl2 / skyl3 / skyl4**: Heights of the cloud layers in feet above ground level, corresponding to skyc1, skyc2, etc. These are NaN if no clouds are observed.

17. **wxcodes**: Weather phenomena codes (e.g., "RA" for rain, "SN" for snow). NaN if none are reported.

18. **ice_accretion_1hr / 3hr / 6hr**: Ice accretion in inches over the past 1, 3, or 6 hours. Often NaN unless icing conditions are present.

19. **peak_wind_gust**: The peak wind gust observed during the reporting period, in knots.

20. **peak_wind_drct**: The direction of the peak wind gust, in degrees from true north.

21. **peak_wind_time**: The time at which the peak wind gust occurred.

22. **feel**: Apparent temperature or "feels like" temperature in Fahrenheit.

23. **metar**: The raw METAR string representing the full weather observation report.

24. **snowdepth**: Snow depth in inches, often NaN if no snow is present.

25. **valid_ET**: The timestamp of the observation in local Eastern Time (ET).

26. **Day Of Week ET**: The day of the week, possibly encoded as an integer where 0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, etc.

27. **sunrise / sunset**: Timestamps for sunrise and sunset at the observation location, in UTC.

28. **daylight**: A boolean indicating whether the observation was made during daylight hours (`True`) or not (`False`).

This should give you a good understanding of what each column represents!
