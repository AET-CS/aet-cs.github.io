The file weather.csv contains observational weather data for Leesburg, VA. I want you to
analyze the hypothesis "the fall of 2023 had more cloudy and rainy weekends than normal."
You don't need to do a full statistical analysis with a formal conclusion, but do what you
can to work with the data. What questions do you have? What pre-processing is relevant?
What types of calculations would support or refute the claim? Do you know how to make
those calculations in Python or another language or tool?
