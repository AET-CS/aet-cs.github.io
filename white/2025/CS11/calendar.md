## Daily Calendar
- September 11, 2025 (Thursday)
    - We did some code tracing practice today. [boolean](./practice/tracing/boolean.md), [loops](./practice/tracing/simple.md) and [tricky](./practice/tracing/ap-level.md)
    - **HW**: Please code up the problems on your selected worksheet and verify if your answers are correct. [More info](./practice/tracing/coding.md)
    - I was going to ask you to do this: Submit powers of two writeup [here](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). You can turn in code in any language or prose or pseudocode -- anything logical. If you get a chance please do. Thanks!
- September 9, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - Download IntelliJ Community Edition and run a sample program. Explore debugger.
    - Work in assigned groups: compare your powers of two code and get one solution working for everybody
    - You can use this [powers of two](./PowerOfTwoFinder.java) solution if you need to
    - HW: Modify your group's solution to work for powers of 4, e.g. 100 = 64+16+16+4. Trace through code with debugger if you don't understand how it works
- September 5, 2025 (Friday)
    - RPN Quiz
    - Writing numbers as sums of: Fibonacci, powers of two, odds, powers of three
    - HW: Write a procedure (or code) to explain how to convert a number into a list of powers of 2 that add to that number. E.g. on input "23" you should output 16,4,2,1. Write code if you know how, otherwise plain English is fine. Explain how you pick the numbers to output in a logical way. Please bring a typed printed copy of your answer to class. (If you can code well enough to output a binary string given an integer input, that's cool too.)
- September 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - four fours puzzle
    - Go over sqrt2 Google sheet [solution key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsKIcdqbSvRl5LXcfM2sJ_XfYE1svEggTNu5w00zUK0/edit?usp=sharing). Make your own copy please
    - RPN quiz next class
        - Here's some [practice and notes](https://adacomputerscience.org/concepts/trans_rpn)
        - Practice from class [last week](./rpn_worksheet.pdf) and the [answers](./rpn_worksheet_answers.pdf)
        - Worked out [rpn problems](./RPN-Stack-Problems.pdf) that show every step with a stack
    - Check the Google sheet above for the *answer key* to the polynomial root problem.
- August 28, 2025 (Thursday)
