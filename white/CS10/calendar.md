# Calendar for CS 10


- 8/23/24: Intro to class. We reviewed the class webpage, yearly curriculum, grading and homework policies. Everybody ran "Hello World" to make sure their laptop is OK and we did some `codingbat` problem. Finally we worked on some coding challenges in groups. [Day 1 Coding Challenges](day01.md)

- 8/27/24: Check your coding challenge solutions with these files [Longest Prefix](../code/LongestPrefix.java) -- [String to Integer](../code/AtoIProblem.java)-- [Roman Numeral](../code/RomanToInt.java) -- [Reverse Integer](../code/ReverseInt.java). Run the file in your local IDE and provide the solution where it's asked for.
  **Homework:** Finish all four problems and bring your solutions to class. If you can't solve one, come with code and precise questions so you can get help.

- 8/29/24: ~~Go over coding challenge problems in class~~. Begin lesson on boolean algebra and truth tables. Work through the problems on the [Boolean Algebra Worksheet](./boolean.pdf). **HW** Finish boolean worksheet (doesn't need to be typed). Do the circuit simulation online if you can figure out the website! If not, we'll look at it next class.

- 9/4/24 (Wednesday): Go over 4 coding challenge problems in class. Review Boolean Algebra homework. DeMorgan's Laws. New coding project: [Truth Tables](../AP_shared/truth-tables.md) You will need [this parser](../code/BooleanExpressionParser.java) to complete part 4.

- 9/6/24 (Friday): Continue working on Truth Tables in class.

- 9/10/24 (Tuesday): Finish and turn in Truth Tables. Work on [Credit Card](../AP_shared/Credit%20Card%20Validation.pdf) In class work on [Coding Bat Arrays 2](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2) or [Coding Bat Arrays 3](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2)
