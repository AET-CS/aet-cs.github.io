title: Girls in Stem
---


Amazon has partnered with LCPS and ACL to host a Girls in STEM event on Saturday, May 2nd for up to 500 female middle school students. Amazon is coordinating with Central Office to run many of the sessions, but has asked if we have any teachers who would be willing to support the growth and development of these students by running two identical 50 minute STEM engagement sessions.

This might look like:
Running an engineering design project that could be completed within a 50 minute time period
Having the students complete a hands on sheet metal/plumbing/construction project in the skilled trades labs
Touring a research lab to see what academic/scientific research might look like
Planting some seeds while learning about soil properties in the greenhouse
Running through modules/rotations in our HMS labs to learn about different career opportunities in that field

These are just examples of what can be done. This opportunity is open to all teachers and presents an excellent opportunity to give back to our community in a very meaningful way.
