  - Continue Research Brainstorm. Add to [this file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ME4WEPHl4WExeAzCSBX33trG_vVQVpxoO0uZJl7lxv4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Wow OK I just checked that file and it looks great. Please review and see if you get even more ideas
  - Today's goal, at the end of class, add YOUR NAME to the **same** file and three specific project ideas:
    - They should be specific enough that I can understand them, but don't over specify too early
    - They should have some clear path forward -- things that look like they can be done
    - It's OK if they have parts that you can't see how to do yet.
    - They should each be a research idea, or an invention, or a product (hardware, software, etc).
	- Finally if you had to pick a Sr research direction (including but not limited to: AI/ML, App Dev, game dev, software dev, compilers, OS, computer vision, networking, cybersecurity, really ANYTHING). what would what area be? This is not a commitment, just a survey. Add that below your name.
