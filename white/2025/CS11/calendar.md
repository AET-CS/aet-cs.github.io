    - Pattern Matching
        - Match the methods in [this code](./practice/patterns/PatternMatching.java) to
        [this output](./practice/patterns/PatternMatching.pdf). Not all methods will be used!
        - Run the code to see the answer
    - Download [DrawingDemo](./practice/drawing/DrawingDemo.java) and [stdlib](./practice/drawing/stdlib.jar)
        - Make a New IntelliJ project called DrawingDemo
        - Copy in the java file above and add the stdlib.jar to your src/ folder
        - Make sure your file name DrawingDemo.java matches the class name DrawingDemo (so rename Main.java if you have one)
        - Right click on stdlib.jar and choose "add library"
        - Run the code
    - HW: Make your own picture!
    - Test rescheduled for Friday October 10! Test will cover content up through today (stopping with patterns).
- Sept 25, 2025 (Thursday)
    - Circuits puzzle(s)
    - Circuits [key](./practice/booleans/circuits-key.md) is available
    - Look at my [solutions](./practice/patterns/PatternPractice.java) to "Make that Pattern!". Even if you got all of them, compare your solutions to mine. If you didn't get any, study these solutions. I think they're (maybe) the easiest-to-understand way to solve them. (But there are many different solutions).
    - Try harder puzzles now, after you've seen my key. See if my solutions help you get some harder ones!
    - Challenge: Build a 3-Majority circuit using at least one XOR gate.
- Sept 23, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - Finish and discuss digital circuits
    - Work on [pattern puzzle](./practice/patterns/patterns.md), [pattern challenge](./practice/patterns/pattern-challenges.md) and/or [josephus](./practice/patterns/josephus.md)
    - Circuits [key](./practice/booleans/circuits-key.md) is available
    - HW is to finish *pattern puzzle* worksheet and/or additional hard problems (do problems according to your skill and challenge level!). Submit to [this form](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). You will have some time next class (Thursday) to finish if needed, and ask questions.
- Sept 19, 2025
    - Tracing and Boolean Quiz!
    - Building Digital Circuits [info](./practice/booleans/circuits.md)
    - *Turn In* labeled screenshots in one doc to [this form](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418)
        - We'll have a bit of time next class to work on this if you don't finish all over the weekend. (But only a bit!)
- Sept 17, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - Try out [tracing modifictions](./practice/tracing/simple-mod.md). If needed you can use this [tracing code](./practice/tracing/tracing.java)

    - Short quiz next class: review Boolean Algebra and Tracing worksheet. Practice
        - more [tracing](./practice/tracing/simple-2.md) with [code](./practice/tracing/tracing2.java) and [detailed tracing tables](./practice/tracing/simple-2-detail.md) and [key](./practice/tracing/simple-2-key.md)
        - extra [boolean practice](./practice/booleans/booleans-2.md) or [pdf](./practice/booleans/booleans-2.pdf)

    - Finish [Truth Tables](./practice/booleans/truth-tables.md) or [pdf](./practice/booleans/truth-tables.pdf). Note which problems yield equivalent truth tables and write down (also remember!) the rules implied by these equivalencies.
    - Turn in *powers of two* and *tracing* to [this form](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). Your *tracing* solution should be a java file, *powers of two* could be any format depending on how you answered the question.
    - **HW**: Make sure your truth tables are correct and you have the correct equivalencies in your notes. Here's [a key](./practice/booleans/truth-tables-key.pdf)
- September 11, 2025 (Thursday)
    - We did some code tracing practice today. [boolean](./practice/tracing/boolean.md), [loops](./practice/tracing/simple.md) and [tricky](./practice/tracing/ap-level.md)
    - **HW**: Please code up the problems on your selected worksheet and verify if your answers are correct. [More info](./practice/tracing/coding.md)
    - I was going to ask you to do this: Submit powers of two writeup [here](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). You can turn in code in any language or prose or pseudocode -- anything logical. If you get a chance please do. Thanks!
- September 9, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - Download IntelliJ Community Edition and run a sample program. Explore debugger.
    - Work in assigned groups: compare your powers of two code and get one solution working for everybody
    - You can use this [powers of two](./PowerOfTwoFinder.java) solution if you need to
    - HW: Modify your group's solution to work for powers of 4, e.g. 100 = 64+16+16+4. Trace through code with debugger if you don't understand how it works
- September 5, 2025 (Friday)
    - RPN Quiz
    - Writing numbers as sums of: Fibonacci, powers of two, odds, powers of three
    - HW: Write a procedure (or code) to explain how to convert a number into a list of powers of 2 that add to that number. E.g. on input "23" you should output 16,4,2,1. Write code if you know how, otherwise plain English is fine. Explain how you pick the numbers to output in a logical way. Please bring a typed printed copy of your answer to class. (If you can code well enough to output a binary string given an integer input, that's cool too.)
- September 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - four fours puzzle
    - Go over sqrt2 Google sheet [solution key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsKIcdqbSvRl5LXcfM2sJ_XfYE1svEggTNu5w00zUK0/edit?usp=sharing). Make your own copy please
