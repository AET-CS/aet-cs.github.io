# Tools

These are tools for managing the notebooks in this repository, adapted from
Jake Vanderplas' [Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook).

- ``generate_contents.py``: This will generate a markdown table of contents for use in the README.md.

- ``add_navigation.py``: This script adds navigation links at the top and bottom of each notebook.

- ``add_book_info.py``: This script adds book information to the top of each notebook.
