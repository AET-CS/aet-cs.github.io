## Part 1: COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test

You're using a COVID-19 rapid antigen test during a period when the local infection rate is 8% (meaning 8 out of every 100 people in your community currently have COVID-19). Based on real clinical studies, this type of rapid antigen test has an average sensitivity of 69.3% and specificity of 99.3%.

You take the test and it comes back **positive**. What is the probability that you actually have COVID-19?

**Given information:**

  - Prior probability (prevalence): P(COVID+) = 0.08
  - Sensitivity: P(Test+ | COVID+) = 0.693
  - Specificity: P(Test- | COVID-) = 0.993


## Part 2

Why is "What is the probability that you actually have COVID-19?" a stupid, bad and wrong question and yet this is how experts talk.
