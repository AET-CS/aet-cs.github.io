    - Look at my [solutions](./practice/patterns/PatternPractice.java) to "Make that Pattern!". Even if you got all of them, compare your solutions to mine. If you didn't get any, study these solutions. I think they're (maybe) the easiest-to-understand way to solve them. (But there are many different solutions).
    - Try harder puzzles now, after you've seen my key. See if my solutions help you get some harder ones!
    - Challenge: Build a 3-Majority circuit using at least one XOR gate.

    - **HW**: Please code up the problems on your selected worksheet and verify if your answers are correct. [More info](./practice/tracing/coding.md)
    - I was going to ask you to do this: Submit powers of two writeup [here](https://forms.gle/APqbyXL2qbhvvU418). You can turn in code in any language or prose or pseudocode -- anything logical. If you get a chance please do. Thanks!

    - HW: Write a procedure (or code) to explain how to convert a number into a list of powers of 2 that add to that number. E.g. on input "23" you should output 16,4,2,1. Write code if you know how, otherwise plain English is fine. Explain how you pick the numbers to output in a logical way. Please bring a typed printed copy of your answer to class. (If you can code well enough to output a binary string given an integer input, that's cool too.)
- September 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - four fours puzzle
    - Go over sqrt2 Google sheet [solution key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsKIcdqbSvRl5LXcfM2sJ_XfYE1svEggTNu5w00zUK0/edit?usp=sharing). Make your own copy please
