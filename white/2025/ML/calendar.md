## Daily Review

- September 10, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - Finish [Linear Regression Notebook](./notebooks/Least-Squares.ipynb) due [here](https://forms.gle/RHYWxdPu4VhCq2js6)
    - [Notes on Coefficient of Determination](./notes/Correlation_Coefficient.md) and goodness of fit for numerical models.
    - Work on [Correlation Notebook](./notebooks/Correlation.ipynb)
    - Find a dataset on the internet somewhere and perform a single-variable linear regression. Make appropriate plots and discuss the quality of your fit.
- September 8, 2025 (Monday)
    - Announcement: [US AI Olympiad](../common/AI-olympiad.md)
    - Linear Regression
    - [Notes](./notes/Linear_regression_derivation.pdf) on derivation of linear regression formula
    - Work on [Linear Regression Notebook](./notebooks/Least-Squares.ipynb) due at end of class [here](https://forms.gle/RHYWxdPu4VhCq2js6)
    - Optional [Numpy Intro](./notebooks/Numpy-Intro.ipynb)
- September 4, 2025 (Thursday)
    - Turn in Leesburg Weather [here](https://forms.gle/RHYWxdPu4VhCq2js6)
    - Turn in Bayes Theorem [same link](https://forms.gle/RHYWxdPu4VhCq2js6)
    - Go over Bayes Theorem and Weather notebooks
    - Work on London Weather project. Due at end of class!
        - Consider the [London Weather dataset](./data/london_weather.csv). Investigate the question “Has the weather in London gotten worse in the last 50 years?” Analyse the data and make a claim that you can support. Demonstrate the validity of your claim with graphical analysis. Include trendlines or statistical analysis as appropriate. You can define what makes weather "worse" -- part of this is definitely subjective. Write your conclusions within your jupyter notebook using markdown syntax (see exiting notebooks for examples.)[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data) for dataset, which retrieved the data from [here](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php)

    - HW: Due next class = Bayes Theorem notebook and Weather Exercises form last class. (Bring questions if you're stuck! You should do weather exercises 1-3 at least)
- August 27, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - More weather. Try some of [these exercises](./weather_exercises.md)
- August 25, 2025 (Monday)
