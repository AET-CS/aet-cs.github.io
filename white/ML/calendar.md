## Daily Review

	- Research brainstorm [this file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ME4WEPHl4WExeAzCSBX33trG_vVQVpxoO0uZJl7lxv4/edit?usp=sharing)

  - Continue Research Brainstorm. Add to [this file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ME4WEPHl4WExeAzCSBX33trG_vVQVpxoO0uZJl7lxv4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Wow OK I just checked that file and it looks great. Please review and see if you get even more ideas
  - Today's goal, at the end of class, add YOUR NAME to the **same** file and three specific project ideas:
    - They should be specific enough that I can understand them, but don't over specify too early
    - They should have some clear path forward -- things that look like they can be done
    - It's OK if they have parts that you can't see how to do yet.
    - They should each be a research idea, or an invention, or a product (hardware, software, etc).
	- Finally if you had to pick a Sr research direction (including but not limited to: AI/ML, App Dev, game dev, software dev, compilers, OS, computer vision, networking, cybersecurity, really ANYTHING). what would what area be? This is not a commitment, just a survey. Add that below your name.

  - Research: Take one of your research ideas, and do some background research. Find 3 peer reviewed papers or articles that relate in some way to a piece of the puzzle. It's fine if the articles are for different ideas -- you don't have to overspecify at this point. For each article, read it carefully and be able to answer: "What relevant question about your project does this article answer?" and "What new question does it raise."
  - Create a Google Doc (for now, even though I hate Google Docs) and cite your 3 articles, link directly to them, and answer the two questions. Do this in class today please. Share the Google Doc with me.
  - Hardware: If you haven't yet, finish setting up tf-gpu on a laptop you can use. Please crowdsource this until it works.
  - Cloud: You should probably get a cloud computing account to use if you need some heavy duty computing. You should try any/all of the following
	and see what you think: Google Colab (free but slow) AWS Sagemaker Studio Lab, Lightning.ai, Paperspace, lambda labs, something else? IDK if these
	are blocked by the firewall or what exactly you have to do to sign up but they all have some kind of free tier. Try them out and see what you think.
	- I'm hoping to get us some cloud computing accounts somewhere but for now no clue if that will happen.
