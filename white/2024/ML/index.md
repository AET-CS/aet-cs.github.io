# Machine Learning

  * Instructor: Dr. White
  * Room: 2312
  * Meeting Days: Block 3, A days

## Welcome

Welcome to the Junior Research Machine Learning class. This course has a dual focus:
to develop a thorough understanding of machine learning algorithms and data analysis
techniques, and also to help develop your innate ability to be creative.

## About this Class

In this course, we will cover a wide range of ML topics, including:

- **Supervised Learning**: Learn about regression, classification, and model evaluation.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Explore clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
- **Neural Networks**: Get hands-on with deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Understand how machines can learn from their environment through trial and error.

We will also discuss techniques for finding and cleaning data sets,
pre-processing and wrangling data before you can feed it to an ML algorithm, and the
many various (and sometimes contradictory) ways you can interpret your results.

The research part of this class includes many facets, including brainstorming ideas,
presenting to the class, reading articles, discussing articles and ideas in groups and
working on whatever interests you in short or long term projects supported by the teacher
and your classmates.

### Homework etc

Most of your classwork/homework will be centered on writing python scripts to analyze datasets.
Some projects will be short that you can do in 20-30 minutes. Some will take much longer. Additionally we will have research-related activites like described above, sprinkled throughout the course.
