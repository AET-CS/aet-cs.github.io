## Daily Log (9/30/25-10/5/25)



### Tuesday September 30

Today I worked on installing Photoshop. Details...

### Friday October 3

Today I wrote an Chrome Extension that reminds me to meditate. Details..

### Saturday October 4

If you work outside of school time, include it in your journal as well. In general, absence from school does not excuse you from research that day -- I expect you'll make it up a different day that week if possible.

## Reflection

A detailed person accounting of how this week went, how your project is going, description of successes and failures. If you
need(ed) to change goals, or refocus your project, explain it here. If you have specific questions or needs, you can list them here.
This is a good place to include photos, diagrams, screenshots, code, etc. if it's especially relevant.
