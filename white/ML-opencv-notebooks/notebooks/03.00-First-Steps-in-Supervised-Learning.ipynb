    "\n",
    "OpenCV provides a pretty straightforward interface for all its statistical\n",
    "learning models, which includes all supervised learning models.\n",
    "In OpenCV, every machine learning model derives from the `cv::ml::StatModel` base\n",
    "class. This is fancy talk for saying that if we want to be a machine learning model in\n",
    "OpenCV, we have to provide all the functionality that `StatModel` tells us to. This includes\n",
    "a method to train the model (called `train`) and a method to measure the performance of\n",
    "the model (called `calcError`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to this organization of the software, setting up a machine learning model in\n",
    "OpenCV always follows the same logic:\n",
    "- **Initialization**: We call the model by name to create an empty instance of the model.\n",
    "- **Set parameters**: If the model needs some parameters, we can set them via setter methods, which can be different for every model. For example, in order for a $k$-NN algorithm to work, we need to specify its open parameter, $k$ (as we will find out later).\n",
    "- **Train the model**: Every model must provide a method called `train`, used to fit the model to some data.\n",
    "- **Predict new labels**: Every model must provide a method called `predict`, used to predict the labels of new data.\n",
    "- **Score the model**: Every model must provide a method called `calcError`, used to measure performance. This calculation might be different for every model."
