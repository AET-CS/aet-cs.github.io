**Note:** Going forward, most of your journals can probably include pictures of some kind of results or progress. Please include whenever applicable. For example if you say "my model is 85% correct" you can show me a training curve or a confusion matrix. If you say "I designed a piano," take a picture of it.

**Also note:** Journals are due even if you are absent. Please email if at all possible and follow up with a hard copy ASAP. Thanks!

## Other dates of interest

* Week of Nov 12-21, show a quick demo of your program, model, etc, doing something live in class, on the TV. (This is a general expectation, feel free to modify it relative to your specific work but I want to see something doing something! Or the result of something already done.)
* RSEF: There are some deadlines related to RSEF that will give us all some data-entry tasks over the next week or so (even if you're not in RSEF, we'll still fill out the forms)
* Ordering: order soon!
