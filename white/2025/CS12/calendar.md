## Daily Calendar


- October 6, 2025 (Monday)
    - PSAT Day; short class
    - Test next class. Review material coming soon. You should know
        - RPN [practice](./practice/rpn.html)
        - Tracing (all AP topics covered last year plus simple recursion, and Stack/LinkedList/Queue) [practice](./practice/tracing.html)
        - Stacks and Queues [practice](./practice/stacks_and_queues.html)
        - LinkedList and DoubleLinkedList [practice](./practice/linked_lists.html)
        - For the data structures, know their running time bounds, pros and cons, and how specifically we implemented them in class
- October 1, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - Unrelated [surveys for AP Stats](./stats.md)
    -  Finish Part 1 of Calculator
    - As time allows, implement extensions (any order you choose)
    - Here are notes on [adding precedence](./Calculator/precedence.md) and [parenthesis](./Calculator/parenthesis.md)
    - Submit in class, a screen video of your calculator demonstrating implemented features. [here](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9)
- September 29, 2025 (Monday)
    - New project: Calculator
        - Read the [description](./Calculator/calculator-instructions.md)
        - Download the [files](./Calculator/Calculator.zip)
        - Unzip the folder and create an IntelliJ project from existing sources (select the folder)
        - Complete the assignment as defined in "Part 1"
    - Test moved to Wed Oct 8
- September 25, 2025 (Thursday)
    - LinkedList Submission due [here](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9)
    - Implement DoubleLinkedList and check with [tester](./LinkedLists/DoubleLinkedListTester.java)
    - Submit DoubleLinkedList.java [here](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9) **due before next class please**
    - Test next Friday
- September 23, 2025 (Tuesday)
    - New assignment: Implement Linked Lists by completing [this file](./LinkedLists/LinkedList.java) and test with [this driver](./LinkedLists/LinkedListTester.java)
- September 19, 2025 (Friday)
    - Final Analysis of Stacks/Queues due now [here](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9)
    - Quiz over stack, queue, AP review tracing
- September 17, 2025 (Wednesday)
    - Discuss results of Stack/Queue timing
    - [Further analysis](./notes/stack-log-log.md) of timing results using log-log plots
    - Re-implement Stack/Queue using `LinkedList` and the methods `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst` and `removeLast`
    - Finally, time your new Stack/Queue and compare the new timings to the old timings. Create new graphs to *clearly* illustrate what is different and/or interesting. Add these to your same write-up as below (so you should have 3 sections -- original results, log-log plots and new results which should contain regular and log-log plots).
    - Quiz Friday (not a test, a quiz) over recent stuff: stacks, queues, some tracing

- September 15, 2025 (Monday)
    - **Please join AP Classroom Now with code NVYVWX (non-testing)**
    - Warm-up. How many orderings are possible if you push `1 2 3` onto the stack in that order, but pop them off at any point? (Hint: not all 6 ordering are possible!) What about `1 2 3 4`? Do you see a pattern?
    - Queue and Stack are past-due so please turn in if you haven't already
    - New assignment: [Timing Queues and Stacks](./notes/stack-queue-timing.md)
    - TURN IN assignment *as a pdf* C
    - Quiz Friday (not a test, a quiz) over recent stuff: stacks, queues, some tracing
- September 11, 2025
    - Review these [tracing questions](./tracing-AP.MD) also as a [pdf](./tracing-AP.pdf)
    - Here's a [key](./tracing-AP-key.md)
    - Stack and Queue Data structures
    - **HW**: Finish and submit Stack.java [here](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9)
    - **HW**: Download [Queue Driver](./Queue/QueueDriver.java) and implement a Queue class in "Queue.java", by modifying your Stack class. Submit finished code [here](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9)
- September 9, 2025
    - RPN Evaluator quiz
    - Install [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) for your laptop (make sure you scroll down on this page).
        - Once downloaded, run the installer. When it asks, you should associate .java files with IntelliJ.
        - Once installed, run IntelliJ and create a new project named "HelloWorld"
            - It will probably want to Download Oracle Java 24
            - You should allow it to create 'sample code'
            - Run the .java by clicking on the green triangle at top.
    - Finish [all RPN extensions](./rpn-sample-output.md) and [submit code](https://forms.gle/9aYEH6EQAQUDc96j9) **This is HW Due ASAP**
    - **This will be finished in class next time** Implement a Stack data structure by extending an Array List. Here's [shell code](./Stack/Stack.java) and a [driver file](./Stack/StackDriver.java). Make sure all tests pass
- September 5, 2025 (Friday)
    - RPN Quiz
