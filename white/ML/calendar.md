# Teaching Calendar

- 8/22/2024. Introduction to class. See [more details](lessons/hw01.md)
- 8/26/2024. Didn't It Rain? [Exploring data](lessons/hw02.md) Also here's a [fix for WSL and Python](lessons/wsl.md)
- 8/28/2024. Present findings from weather data. [Class Notes](lessons/cw03.md). Discuss Bayes' Theorem.
	- HW: Finish [Bayes' Theorem notebook.](lessons/Bayes_Theorem_Student.ipynb) ([html version](./lessons/Bayes_Theorem_Student.html)). Please read [this intro](lessons/jupyter-python-intro.md) to jupyter and python lists if you need some pointers.
- 9/3/2024 (Tuesday) Turn in Bayes homework. Quick library orientation. New notes on Linear Regression -- [new notes provided](./lessons/Linear_regression_derivation.pdf).
	- HW: Complete the [linear regression notebook](./lessons/least-squares-01.ipynb), ([html version](./lessons/least-squares-01.html)) for classwork/homework. As an application, do a linear regression on the London weather dataset (this part is *not* HW yet but will be). For next class: pick some new ideas from your *Money List* to discuss.
- 9/5/2024 (Thursday) Turn in Linear Regression homework. Go over Bayes and Regression notebooks in class. [Bayes Key](lessons/Bayes_Theorem_Key.html) Discuss goodness of fit measures for categorical and quantitative data. Notes on [Pearson's Correlation Coefficient](./lessons/Correlation_Coefficient.pdf).
	- Classwork: perform a linear regression on the [London weather dataset](./data/london_weather.csv).
	- Then find your own dataset somewhere and perform a linear regression on it. In both cases use the LR algorithm you coded already; do not use built-in linear regression tools, please. Make your data analysis into a nice, brief write-up (emphasis on brief) and turn it in before class ends (as a jupyter notebook).
	- Classwork: Discuss some recent *money list* ideas
	- HW: Finish classwork, any other old notebooks that aren't done yet
- 9/9/2024 (Monday) Unit Topic: Matrices in Python and Numpy. Today we will code up standard algorithms for performing matrix arithmetic operations using Python lists. Please download and modify [this matrix notebook](./lessons/Matrices-student.ipynb) ([pdf](./lessons/Matrices-student.pdf)) and ftp it to the pi when you're finished. The next notebook on Gaussian elimination will be provided later.
- 9/11/2024 (Wednesday)  Gaussian elimination, on paper and using numpy.
	- [Intro to numpy arrays and operations](./lessons/Intro_to_Matrices_in_NumPy.ipynb) ([html](./lessons/Intro_to_Matrices_in_NumPy.html)).
	- [Matrix indices warmup](./lessons/Matrices_Index_Warmup-Student.ipynb) ([html](./lessons/Matrices_Index_Warmup-Student.html))
	- [Gaussian Elimination notebook](./lessons/Gaussian_Elimination-student.ipynb) ([pdf](./lessons/Gaussian_Elimination-student.pdf)). You'll need [this picture](./lessons/error-scatterplot.png) to display the Gaussian notebook properly, in the same folder. (only turn in this notebook when you finish Friday)
- 9/13/2024 (Friday) Complete regression analysis of error terms in Gaussian Elimination lab. Notes of [log-log regression](./lessons/LogLogRegression.html) ([notebook](./lessons/LogLogRegression.ipynb))
	- Turn in Matrix lab and Gauss lab today please
	- Extensions (optional):
		- [Strassen Multiplication](./lessons/Strassen-Lab.pdf)
		- [Gaussian Biography](./lessons/Gauss.pdf)
		- Matrix inversion (tbd -- I have some ideas here but not sure...)
