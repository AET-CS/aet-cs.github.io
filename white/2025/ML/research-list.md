title: Brainstorming Research Projects
---

- Goal: You will brainstorm 3 research project ideas and make a short slideshow pitching your ideas. At least one idea must be an extension of research you read in a publication

- Background: You have seen some student research projects in recent days. Now I want you to take some time to think about your research project for next year. By the end of class today I want you to have 3 plausible research ideas and describe them briefly in a short slide show. Coming up with a good topic is probably the hardest part of research! You are just beginning the process today of ideas. Anything is on the table.
- Resources: I recommend reading through this [brainstorm list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOI2ZtU3p6eWbUpF7AH63rveKzSbwLmQUTAv5eXUgHc/edit?usp=sharing) from last year's ML class. It starts out very stream-of-conscious but coalesces into concrete ideas from each student. For published work look at [this list I made](../../2024/ML/background.md) of accessible research.
- Be an inventor: I find the best research projects start out as *products*. Think of making a thing that does a thing. Start with a need -- what do you see that's wrong and how can you fix it? Pure research projects are of course allowed, but even pure research usually starts by serving an end goal.

- **Do This**: Follow the links above. Read. Think. Brainstorm. Discuss. Argue. Then settle on 3 ideas. They don't have to be great. Put them in a slideshow. 1-2 slides per idea. You will not be presenting this, so feel free to add a lot of text to explain your thought process.

- **Turn in today** your slides by adding a link inside [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pM_jeWy6uVkNoAjsYeF7WOIZRZKsSIGgRLqKpc7Ovb8/edit?usp=sharing). Also add a brief description of your ideas.
