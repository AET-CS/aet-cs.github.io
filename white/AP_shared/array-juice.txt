# Juice Mind Array Activity


Part 1: (9 points) For each of the given 2D arrays, compete the associated method to print the values 1 to 16 in ascending order. You will need nested loops for all of them. For the last one, the pattern is different in the lower left triangle than in the upper right triangle. It will require a pair of nested loops.

Part 2: (1 point) Complete the method flatten(). It will take in a [2n][2n] array and return a [n][4n] array, with each row being the concatenation of a pair of rows from the input.  For example,

int [][] a = { {1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8},{8,9,10,11},{12,13,14,15}};

flatten(a) should return

{{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8},{8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}}
