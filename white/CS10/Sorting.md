# Sorting Assignment

Please download a project for your coding environment: VSCode, IntelliJ or Command Line. Compile and run the sample code.

*Goal* You will analyze the running time of various sorting algorithms on lists on increasing size. You will chart the results.

# Steps:

1. Download and run sample code.
2. Implement a method to generate a random array of integers of a given size, with each integer in a given range [min, max].
3. Implement insertionSort, selectionSort, mergeSort. These methods will take an input array and sort that array  in increasing order.
4. Graph each sort algorithm this way: For several arrays sizes ()
